One firm I travelled with a lot in earlier days has slipped down my preference list because they choose very basic accommodation, and don't feed customers well. The older I get, the more I consider comfort - not just by preference but because an uncomfortable night in poor accommodation means creakier bones next day.

I am an eBird reviewer and have been since eBird began. I have written a book on status and distribution for my home state. I have been a Regional Editor of North American Birds,  I have guided bird trips across the US, led hundreds of bird walks for local organizations. I have all the equipment (scope, audio recording, camera, etc., a birding library of over 1000 titles). However, your characterization of a hardcore birder as someone who is primarily in pursuit of adding species to their lists is misguided and misinformed. I do not keep a life list. I have no idea how many species I have observed nor any interest in counting them. I also travel to be with friends and family, but will find time to bird while doing so.
