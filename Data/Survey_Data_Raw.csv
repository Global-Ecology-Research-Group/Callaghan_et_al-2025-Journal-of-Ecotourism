If I have a good experience with a company, I am likely to consider them again - and in fact, have done so.  One firm I travelled with a lot in earlier days has slipped down my preference list because they choose very basic accommodation, and don't feed customers well. The older I get, the more I consider comfort - not just by preference but because an uncomfortable night in poor accommodation means creakier bones next day.

I can identify every bird I see, hear, and know when and where to find them. I have discovered state firsts, and countless county firsts. I sit on multiple records committees. I am an eBird reviewer and have been since eBird began. I have written a book on status and distribution for my home state. I have been a Regional Editor of North American Birds,  I have guided bird trips across the US, led hundreds of bird walks for local organizations. I have all the equipment (scope, audio recording, camera, etc., a birding library of over 1000 titles). However, your characterization of a hardcore birder as someone who is primarily in pursuit of adding species to their lists is misguided and misinformed. I do not keep a life list. I have no idea how many species I have observed nor any interest in counting them. I also travel to be with friends and family, but will find time to bird while doing so. I do not travel exclusively for birding unless I am guiding. "

Goes on trips to watch birds but also enjoys other activities during their trips.","I've been on both sides of the fence when birding - both as a birder/client, as well as leading international birding tours. The motivation remains the same for me - trips that yield as many species as reasonable, with local/regional specialties targeted, but always underpinned by ensuring the tour or trip benefits conservation and local communities as much as possible. Now that I no longer lead tours, it is even more important that any time or money spent seeking out birds yields a positive outcome for conservation. Local birding is less conservation-focused, with enjoyment of being in nature the primary focus."
